| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability in Issue Tracker, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security concerns to: [security@yourproject.com] (replace with actual email)
3. Include as much information as possible about the vulnerability

### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- **Environment**: Affected versions, browsers, operating systems
- **Proof of Concept**: If applicable, include a PoC (without causing harm)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Investigation**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Release**: Within 30 days (depending on severity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and users have time to update

## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- **OAuth Integration**: Secure authentication via Google OAuth
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure session management with proper expiration
- **Session Validation**: All API routes validate user sessions
- **Protected Routes**: Client-side route protection

### Data Protection

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated with Zod schemas
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Prisma ORM prevents SQL injection
- **XSS Protection**: React's built-in XSS protection
- **CSRF Protection**: NextAuth.js CSRF protection

### API Security

- **Authentication Required**: Sensitive operations require authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- **Error Handling**: No sensitive information in error messages
- **HTTPS Only**: Enforce HTTPS in production

### Database Security

- **Connection Security**: Secure MongoDB connection strings
- **Access Control**: Proper database user permissions
- **Data Encryption**: Encryption at rest (MongoDB Atlas)
- **Backup Security**: Secure backup procedures

### Infrastructure Security

- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data in environment variables
- **Secret Management**: Secure handling of API keys and secrets
- **Dependency Updates**: Regular dependency security updates
- **Error Monitoring**: Sentry for error tracking (no sensitive data logged)

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
3. **Validate all inputs** on both client and server
4. **Keep dependencies updated** to patch security vulnerabilities
5. **Use HTTPS** in production environments
6. **Implement proper error handling** without exposing sensitive information

### For Users

1. **Use strong passwords** for your accounts
2. **Keep your browser updated** for latest security patches
3. **Be cautious of phishing** attempts
4. **Log out** when using shared computers
5. **Report suspicious activity** immediately

### For Deployments

1. **Use secure hosting** providers with good security practices
2. **Enable HTTPS** with valid SSL certificates
3. **Configure proper CORS** settings
4. **Set secure headers** (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
5. **Regular security audits** of deployed applications

## Common Vulnerabilities

### Prevented Vulnerabilities

- **SQL Injection**: Prevented by Prisma ORM
- **XSS**: Prevented by React's JSX escaping
- **CSRF**: Prevented by NextAuth.js
- **Session Fixation**: Prevented by proper session management

### Potential Risks

- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Monitor with `npm audit`
- **Configuration Errors**: Improper environment setup
- **Access Control**: Insufficient permission checks
- **Data Exposure**: Logging sensitive information

## Security Headers

Recommended security headers for production:

```nginx
# Content Security Policy
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; font-src 'self' data:; connect-src 'self' https:; frame-ancestors 'none';";

# Strict Transport Security
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload";

# X-Frame-Options
add_header X-Frame-Options "DENY";

# X-Content-Type-Options
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";

# Referrer Policy
add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin";

# Permissions Policy
add_header Permissions-Policy "geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()";
```
