# Contributing to Issue Tracker

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Issue Tracker project! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0 or later
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git
- MongoDB database access
- Google OAuth credentials (for testing auth features)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/issue-tracker.git
   cd issue-tracker
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your configuration
   ```

4. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma db push
   npm run seed
   ```

5. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **TypeScript**: Use strict typing, avoid `any` types
- **Components**: Functional components with hooks
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components)
- **File Structure**: Group related files in directories
- **Imports**: Use absolute imports with `@/` prefix

### Code Formatting

We use ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting:

```bash
# Run linting
npm run lint

# Auto-fix linting issues
npm run lint -- --fix
```

### Component Guidelines

```typescript
// Good: Typed props interface
interface ButtonProps {
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
  children: React.ReactNode;
  onClick?: () => void;
}

const Button = ({ variant = 'primary', children, onClick }: ButtonProps) => {
  return (
    <button 
      className={`btn btn-${variant}`}
      onClick={onClick}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};

// Good: Export with default
export default Button;
```

### API Route Guidelines

```typescript
// Good: Proper error handling and types
export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
    
    if (!session) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { message: "Unauthorized" }, 
        { status: 401 }
      );
    }

    const data = await prisma.issue.findMany();
    return NextResponse.json(data);
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('API Error:', error);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { message: "Internal Server Error" },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}
```

### Database Guidelines

- Always use Prisma for database operations
- Use transactions for multi-step operations
- Include proper error handling
- Use typed Prisma client methods

```typescript
// Good: Proper Prisma usage
const updateIssueWithHistory = await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  const updatedIssue = await tx.issue.update({
    where: { id },
    data: { status },
  });

  await tx.issueHistory.create({
    data: {
      issueId: id,
      action: 'STATUS_CHANGED',
      oldValue: previousStatus,
      newValue: status,
    },
  });

  return updatedIssue;
});
```
